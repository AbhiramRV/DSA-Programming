About data structures and algorithms


#Data Structures
1. Arrays and Strings
2. Hashing(Dictionaries)
 Hash map are mot important in algorithms interviews. They can reduce the algorithm complexity by a factor on O(n). Hash maps store key-value pairs. Checking for existence in a hash map or set is O(1) where as in strings, it is O(n). Anytime you need to count anything, think about using a hash map to do it.
3. Linked lists
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Trees and Graphs
Trees are one of the frequent problems encountered in the interviews.

 Node: Node is an abstract data type. It has two things. First it stores value which can be of any data type. Second, it stores pointer to another node.
 Graph: Graph is collection of nodes and pointers to other other nodes. Nodes of a graph(Tree) are called vertices and pointers that connect nodes are called edges.
 
Tree is a type of graph. In a binary tree, all nodes have maximum of two children. 
There are two main type of tree traversals. 
 1. Depth-First search
   For binary trees especially, DFS can be done in three differnt ways. Preorder, Inorder and postorder.
 2. Breadth First search


6. Heaps

#Algorithms
1. Iterative
Iteration: Using exclusive loop in the program

2. Recursive
Recursion: Recursion is the process of a function calling itself
    For recursion, a good starting point is always the base case.
3. Greedy
4. Binary search
5. Back tracking
6. Dynamic programming
7. Divide and Conquer
